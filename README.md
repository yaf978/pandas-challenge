# pandas-challenge
Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

# OUTCOME:
Based on the data analysis, we have observed:
- from looking at five top-performing schools and Bottom Performing Schools by considering score by school type analysis, that charter school results are much better than district schools.
- The spending amount range per student is not related to the outcome and results. Students scored the highest average score in math, reading, and overall passing rate -in the lowest spending range, and verse versa.
- Conclude that the size of a school affecting on the results. When the size of the school increases, the student's scores decrease.
